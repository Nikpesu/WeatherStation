# ESP32/ESP8266 MQTT WeatherStation for Home Assistant

This project is designed for **ESP32** and **ESP8266** microcontrollers. It uses **MQTT** to send data to **Home Assistant** via the MQTT integration.

### Requirements

* An MQTT broker/server (e.g. Mosquitto)
* A running Home Assistant instance with MQTT integration configured
* Both your device and Home Assistant must connect to the **same MQTT server**
* The MQTT discovery prefix in Home Assistant must be set to `homeassistant` (this is the default)

### 7. Connect to Wi-Fi (If Not Preconfigured)

If you haven't set the Wi-Fi credentials in advance, the device will start in Access Point (AP) mode. To configure it:

1. Connect to the device's hotspot:

   * **SSID:** `ws1`
   * **Password:** `12345678`

2. After connecting, you should be automatically redirected to the configuration homepage.
   If not, open a browser and navigate to: `http://192.168.4.1`

### 8. Done! ðŸŽ‰

Once connected and configured, your device should automatically appear in **Home Assistant** via MQTT Discovery.
You can find your instance on MDNS_hostname.local (default is `ws1.local`)
