# WeatherStation, ESP32/ESP8266 MQTT Integration for Home Assistant

This project is designed for **ESP32** and **ESP8266** microcontrollers. It uses **MQTT** to send data to **Home Assistant** via the MQTT integration.

### Requirements

* An MQTT broker/server (e.g. Mosquitto)
* A running Home Assistant instance with MQTT integration configured
* Both your device and Home Assistant must connect to the **same MQTT server**
* The MQTT discovery prefix in Home Assistant must be set to `homeassistant` (this is the default)
